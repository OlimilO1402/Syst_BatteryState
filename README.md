# Syst_BatteryState  
## Dealing with powrprof.dll, checking your batteries state  
it's all about powrprof.dll. Recently I found some interesting win-api functions in WindowsApiCodePack 1.1.4.    
I didn't even know these dll exists. If program runs on your laptop-computer it can check your battery's state.  
You can do this in your own program by using the class BatteryState.
